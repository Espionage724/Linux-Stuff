%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

- List all active firewall rules
sudo firewall-cmd --list-all

- List potential firewall services
sudo firewall-cmd --get-service

- Add firewall service
sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=SERVICE

- Remove firewall port
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --remove-port=#/tcp

- Run server-related commands not as plain sudo, but run with sudo -u USERNAME (USERNAME being the user dedicated to that service; mysql = mysql, Apache/httpd = apache)
